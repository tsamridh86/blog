# blog
blog for the st assignment 

the userpage & the contact us is not ready, rest everything is up & working by now, maybe lol

all of the classes are inside config folder, css in css, js in js & the rest of the folder are made for easier navigation.

there has been no use of bootstrap, anything resposive inside there is purely by luck
no use of jquery either, it has been done using javascript exclusively
lol, decided to use bs for the index page lulz

the image that will be uploaded into the server, will be ignored here due to the gitignore file, so boo hoo if you wanna snoop in my pics.


How to operate this thing :
1. clone this into ur htdocs folder
2. run xampp the usual drill
3. type in : localhost/blog
4. voila
